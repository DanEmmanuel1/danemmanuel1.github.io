<h1>Creepy-crawlies splash page!</h1>

<p>
In casual language, people use "bugs" to mean all sorts of small
creepy-crawlies: insects, spiders, etc. However, "Bugs" (true bugs)
are actually just one order of insects (Hemiptera). This page
provides a summary of the main classes or groups of
creepy-crawlies.

<h2>Beetles</h2>
<p>Beetles are a group of insects that have hardened forewings, or
<i>elytra</i>, that serve as protective wing cases for their
hindwings. They have a hard exoskeleton and chew their food. They
make up the largest group of animals on Earth.</p>

<h2>True bugs</h2>

and are mostly plant-feeders. They are named after the insect order
<i>Hemiptera</i> (from the Greek <i>Hemi</i> + <i>ptera</i>, meaning
"half wing").</p>
